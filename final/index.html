    <section class="home">
      <h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to a place where we all love computers! Linux is one way that we get to take control and feel closer to
        our hardware!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="home">
      <h2>About Linux</h2>
      <p>Linux is a group of open source operating systems that use the linux kernel. Linux kernel was released on
        September 17 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Today linux powers much of the modern world's computer architecture, though
        not many consumer electronics.</p>

      <h2>Why use Linux?</h2>
      <p>There are several reasons you may want to try Linux, here are a few:</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Control</h3>
        <p>Linux offers the user a great deal more control than a Windows or Mac machine, leading to greater
          customization
          and reliability. With great power comes great responsibility though, the system administrator can cause
          significant damage if they don't know what they are doing.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Learn more about computers</h3>
        <p>Often settings are not hidden by a graphical interface, allowing the user to understand what is happening
          "under the hood". Much of the software on Linux, as well as Linux is open source, meaning it can be examined
          by
          the user and understood.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>This one really depends on you as the user, but Linux can be as private as you decide, as you have control
          over
          what software is running on your computer.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>Linux has lower hardware requirements and can "feel" a great deal more responsive on older systems as
          compared
          to other proprietary operating systems. A great example of this is if your system doesn't meet the
          requirements
          for Windows 11, it should be able to handle Linux no problem.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="home">
      <h2>What is a distribution?</h2>
      <p>Linux is composed of many different distributions. These are all built and maintained by different groups and
        individuals. They are usually focused on different demographics. Distributions like Linux Mint are targeted
        towards beginners while distributions like Arch Linux are for advanced users.</p>
      <p>Different distributions have different package managers, which are collections of software. The default tools
        and software preinstalled on each distribution will also be different.</p>
